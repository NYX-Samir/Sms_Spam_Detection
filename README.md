# Sms_Spam_Detection
SMS spam detection uses machine learning and Streamlit to build a web app that classifies user-input SMS messages as spam or ham. It applies the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm, which learns text patterns from training data to accurately predict new messages. The Streamlit interface allows users to enter an SMS and instantly see the prediction.
